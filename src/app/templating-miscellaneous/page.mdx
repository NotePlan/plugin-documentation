# Miscellaneous

## Escaping
By default, `Templating` will escape all data, which under certain circumstances, may produce unexpected results. In these cases, you can use the `&lt;%-` tag, which instructs `Templating` to render data as it has been received.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="TEMPLATING TAGS"
  description={`
For more information on <code>Templating</code> tags. Visit <a href="templating-tags" alt="templating tags">Templating Tags</a>. 
  `}
/>

### Example 1
You can create output tags which will not auto escape data, but return the raw value in output.

In the following example, data is retrieved from a quote service, and depending on the result, may sometimes include quote marks `'` in output.

```markdown
"&lt;%- web.quote() &gt;%"
```

Could produce something like

```markdown
“You&#39;re doing a great job”
```

### Example 2
Using the same example, if you would like to display raw (unescaped text) you can use `&lt;%-` tag as follows

```markdown
"&lt;%- web.quote() &gt;%"
```

```markdown
“You're doing a great job”
```
