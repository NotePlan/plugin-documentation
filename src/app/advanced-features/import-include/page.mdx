# Include (content) and Import (template code)

Templating offers two very powerful commands, `include()` and `import()`, for bringing content from other notes or templates into your current template in a reusable way. While they sound similar, they serve distinct purposes. Understanding the difference helps you reuse content and build more powerful templates.

## `include(template_title)` 

### Purpose

Use `include()` when you want to insert the **final, rendered content** of another template or the **entire content** of a regular note into your current template.

*   **For Templates:** `include()` processes the target template first – it runs any template tags and uses the included template's frontmatter in the processing – and then inserts the resulting text. 
*   **For Regular Notes or Calendar Notes:** `include()` simply grabs the full text of the note you specify and inserts it.

Think of `include()` as asking NotePlan to fully prepare the content from the other file *before* placing it in your current template. By the time it is included in your current template, it is just text and no longer has any variables or template tags.

### Outcome

The `include()` tag is replaced by either:

*   The **rendered result** of the target template.
*   The **full text content** of the target note

<Callout>
Note that if you are using the `include()` tag to get the contents of a regular note, all the note's content, including any frontmatter/properties, will be included.
</Callout>

### Example: Including the contents of another template

Imagine a super simple template named `MyTemplateToInclude.md` that has a frontmatter attribute `headerTextVariable`:

```markdown
---
title: MyTemplateToInclude
headerTextVariable: "Some text from the included template"
---
# <%- headerTextVariable %>`
```

Using `include()` in another template lets you insert this content from the other template into your current template:

```
---
title: New Template
---
<%- include('MyTemplateToInclude') %>
Some main content here.
```

The output shows the processed other template, including the `#` from the included template:

```
# Some text from the included template
Some main content here.
```

### Example: Including a regular note

Similarly, you have a regular note titled `MyNote` containing:
```
# Just some plain text.
```

Including it will insert the note's content verbatim:

```
---
title: New Template including some plain text
---
<%- include('MyNote') %>
```

Results in:

```
# Just some plain text.
```

### Example: Including the contents of a Calendar Note

Imagine you have a calendar note that contains a list of things you did on a given date. You want to include this list of events in another note.

```
---
title: My Day Summary Note
---
## What I did on 2025-05-02

<% include('2025-05-02') %>
```

<Callout type="info">
A calendar note can be included by either YYYY-MM-DD or in the format YYYYMMDD.
</Callout>

### JavaScript template string Support

Both `include()` and `import()` functions support simple JavaScript template strings -- strings that include dynamic values (e.g. `include('${currentMonth} Monthly Note')` or `import('${currentMonth} Monthly Note')`) in the template name, allowing you to dynamically reference templates based on variables in your defined variables (e.g. in frontmatter):

```javascript
<%- include(`Monthly Notes/${currentMonth} Monthly Note`) %>
<% import(`Snippets/${snippetType} Snippet`) %>
```

This will evaluate `${currentMonth}` to its value (e.g., "July") and include/import the template "Monthly Notes/July Monthly Note" or "Snippets/Header Snippet".

**Supported Features:**
- Basic variable substitution: `${variableName}`
- Nested object properties: `${user.name}`, `${user.settings.theme}`

**Limitations of the JavaScript template string support:**
- Complex JavaScript expressions (like conditional logic, method calls, or default values) inside the JavaScript template string are not evaluated and will be preserved as literal text
- Only simple variable substitution is supported

<Callout type="info">
JavaScript template strings in include() and import() names are evaluated using the current defined variables (e.g. in frontmatter), so make sure your variables are defined before using them in template names.
</Callout>

### Outcome

The `include()` tag is replaced by either:

*   The **rendered result** of the target template.
or
*   The **full text content** of the target note.

## `import(template_title)`

### Purpose

Use `import()` when you want to insert the **raw, unprocessed text** and potentially **template tags** from the *body* of another template file directly into your current template. The frontmatter of the imported template is ignored.

This is ideal for reusing static snippets of text, markdown, or code that you don't want NotePlan to interpret or change during the import step. Any template tags inside the imported text will be processed later, as if they were simply part of the main template.

Think of `import()` as copy-pasting a block of text from another template's body into your current one. In this way, the imported text can process template tags using the target template's frontmatter/properties.

### Outcome

The `import()` tag is replaced by the **raw text/markdown content** from the **body** of the target template file (everything after the `---` frontmatter lines).

### Example: Importing template code from another template

Using the same `MyTemplateToInclude.md` template from the `include()` example above:

```markdown
---
title: MyTemplateToInclude
headerTextVariable: "Some text from the included template"
---
# <%- headerTextVariable %>`
```

If you use `import()` in your main template:

```
---
title: New Template Using Import
headerTextVariable: "Text from the *main* template"
---
<% import('MyTemplateToInclude') %>
Main content.`
```

The output includes the *literal text* (the template code) from the body of `MyTemplateToInclude`, which is rendered as if it were part of the main template. The frontmatter of `MyTemplateToInclude.md` is ignored entirely.
So only the template code is inserted, not the frontmatter, as if the new template held the following:
```
# <%- headerTextVariable %>
Main content.
```

When this is rendered, the `headerTextVariable` tag is processed using the `headerTextVariable` defined in the *main* template (`New Template Using Import`), resulting in:

```
# Text from the *main* template
Main content.
```

<Callout>
Notice the `<%- headerTextVariable %>` tag was inserted exactly as it appeared in `MyTemplateToInclude`. It wasn't processed using the `headerTextVariable` from the imported file's frontmatter. So, NotePlan will render this tag using the `headerTextVariable` defined in the *main* template (`New Template Using Import`).
</Callout>

## Why the Difference? (What should you use?)

Choose the command based on what you need to insert:

*   **`include()`:** For inserting *dynamic, processed content* from another template, or the *entire content* of a regular note. It's like running the included file and using its output.
*   **`import()`:** For inserting *static, reusable blocks of text* or code from a template's body *without* processing them first. It's like copying and pasting raw text.

This gives you control over how you reuse different kinds of content within your templates.
