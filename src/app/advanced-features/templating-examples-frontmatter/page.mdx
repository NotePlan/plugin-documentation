# Creating Notes with Properties/Frontmatter

`Templating` provides support for templates which create notes with properties/frontmatter. The note properties/frontmatter content is placed at the top of the template, between `--` separators and follows the frontmatter of the template.

In the following example, the template frontmatter is at the top between `---` (three dashes) while the note frontmatter (that gets copied into the note) is defined between the two dashes ("--") just below:

```markdown
---
title: this is my template title
type: meeting-note, empty-note
note: These properties are only relevant to the template, not the note
---
--
note: These items will become the new note's properties/frontmatter
name: Mike Erickson
phone: 714.555.1212

icon-color: red-500
--
Any other template content you want to be in the generated note can be placed here...
```

## Prompting for values to be used in the note's frontmatter

You can use prompts in frontmatter/properties to set the value of a frontmatter key of the template as it is rendered.

```markdown
---
title: My Template with Prompt for New Note's Frontmatter
---
--
priority: <%- prompt('priority','What is the new note's priority?',['high','medium','low']) %>
--
```

When the template is rendered, it will display a choice list prompt for the `priority` key, and the value entered will be used as the value of the `priority` key in the new note's frontmatter.


### Example: Complete Frontmatter Template

The following example demonstates a complete frontmatter format template

```markdown
--
name: Mike Erickson
phone: 714.555.1212
modified: <%- date.now('YYYY-MM-DD h:mm A') %>
description: The following content will be ignored when rendering a frontmatter template and cannot contain any carriage returns (this note is auto wrapped)
--

#### Frontmatter Objects

The following is normal template content

name: _<%- frontmatter.name %>_
phone: _<%- frontmatter.phone %>_

#### Other Templating Variables

<%- user.first %> <%- user.last %>
<%- date.now() %>

---

modified: _<%- frontmatter.modified %>_
```

When template is rendered, it will appear as

```markdown
#### Frontmatter Objects

The following is normal template content

name: _Mike Erickson_
phone: _714.555.1212_

#### Other Templating Variables
