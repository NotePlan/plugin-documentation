# Creating Notes with Properties/Frontmatter

Templating supports templates which create notes with properties/frontmatter of their own. 

You can add properties for **the new note's frontmatter** by enclosing it at the very top of the template's body between the `--` (two dashes) separators.

Below is a template, in which:
- the template's frontmatter/properties is at the top
- the note frontmatter (that gets copied into the note) is defined between the two dashes `--` at the very top of the template's body.

<DynamicImage src="template-note-with-frontmatter.png" alt="Note Frontmatter Example" width="70%" />

<Callout type="info">
The two dashes `--` and the properties that follow must be at the very top (the first line) of the template's body. No other text or code can be placed above the two dashes or it will not be interpreted as frontmatter/properties, it will just be part of the note's content.
</Callout>

## Adding the new note properties to your template

You can easily type the `--` at the top and bottom, but Templating includes a command to make this easier.
Just create a new template (or open up an existing one) and run the command: `/Add note properties/frontmatter to template`. This will add the `--` separators and a placeholder for the note's frontmatter at the top of the template exactly where it needs to go.

## The Resulting Note

The resulting note ends up with its own frontmatter fields that were specified in the template body between the `--` separators and can contain prompts. For example, the template above generated this note:

<DynamicImage src="resulting-template.png" alt="Resulting Note Example" width="70%" />

<Callout type="info">
Note how the `bg-color` key was used for both the template and the resulting note (this demonstrates that the template's frontmatter pertains to the template itself and information it needs when creating a new note, while the resulting note's frontmatter pertains to the resulting note). 
</Callout>

## Setting the Note Title with Frontmatter

In the example above, there was no `newNoteTitle` field in the template's frontmatter, so Templating will prompt the user for the title of the new note.

If you want to set the title of the new note in advance or want more control over the title, you can use the `newNoteTitle` field in your template's frontmatter. Read more about  <a href="/core-features/templating-commands#new-note-title">newNoteTitle</a>.

For example, in the template properties, you could set the title to a dynamic value, like the date:

```markdown
newNoteTitle: My note for <%- date.now('YYYY-MM-DD') %>
```

This would not prompt the user, but would set the title to a dynamic value like **"My note for 2025-09-08"**.

or you could use a prompt to get the title from the user:

```markdown
newNoteTitle: My new note about <%- prompt('newNoteTitle',"What is the new note's title?") %>
```

This would prompt the user for the title of the new note and set the title to **"My new note about [what the user entered]"**.

## Prompting for values to be used in the note's frontmatter

You can use prompts in frontmatter/properties to set the value of a frontmatter key of the template as it is rendered.

```markdown
---
title: My Template with Prompt for New Note's Frontmatter
---
--
priority: <%- prompt('priority','What is the new note's priority?',['high','medium','low']) %>
--
```

When the template is rendered, it will display a choice list prompt for the `priority` key, and the value entered will be used as the value of the `priority` key in the new note's frontmatter.


### Example: Complete Frontmatter Template

The following example demonstates a complete frontmatter format template with prompts that populate the new note's frontmatter.

```markdown
---
title: My Template with Prompt for New Note's Frontmatter
newNoteTitle: <%- prompt('newNoteTitle',"What is the new note's title?") %>
---
--
title: <%- newNoteTitle %>
context: <%- prompt('context',"What is the new note's context?") %>
name: Mike Erickson
phone: 714.555.1212
modified: <%- date.now('YYYY-MM-DD h:mm A') %>
description: The following content will be ignored when rendering a frontmatter template and cannot contain any carriage returns (this note is auto wrapped)
--
## <%- prompt('topic1',"What is the first topic in the note?") %>
```

<Callout type="info">
**Prompts**: Prompts are evaluated before the template is rendered, so you can use them to set values of either a frontmatter key to be used in the processing of the template or in the resulting note's frontmatter or body content.
The above example will display 3 prompts in order of appearance in the template:

- a prompt for the `newNoteTitle` key, and the value entered will be used to create the new note's title and the value will be set as the `title` key in the new note's frontmatter. 
- a prompt for the `context` key, and the value entered will be used as the value of the `context` key in the new note's frontmatter. 
- a prompt for the first topic in the new note.

Even though the prompts are in different places in the template, they will all be displayed (in the order they appear in the template) when the template rendering begins. 

</Callout>

## Where to Put the Prompts

There is no right or wrong place to put the prompts, but it is often easier to put them in the main template's frontmatter and access them later **by variable name** where they are needed.

For example, the following template has 3 prompts in the frontmatter and the resulting values are used in various places:

```markdown
---
newNoteTitle: <%- prompt('newNoteTitle',"What is the new note's title?") %>
newNoteContext: <%- prompt('newNoteContext',"What is the new note's context?") %>
firstTopic: <%- prompt('firstTopic',"What is the first topic in the note?") %>
---
--
title: <%- newNoteTitle %>
context: <%- newNoteContext %>
--
## <%- firstTopic %>
```

## Setting the Note Title with Frontmatter

As you see in the example above, you can include a `title` field in your embedded frontmatter (between the `--` separators) to set the title of the new note. This is particularly useful when you want to dynamically generate note titles based on template variables or user prompt input.

For more control over the note title, you can use the `newNoteTitle` field in your template's frontmatter (between the `---` separators). This field allows you to:

- Set the title programmatically using template variables
- Use prompts to get user input for the title
- Reference the title later in your template to create frontmatter

#### Example: Dynamic Title with Template Variables

```markdown
---
title: Meeting Template
type: meeting-note
folder: My Meeting Folder
newNoteTitle: <%- eventTitle %> - <%- eventDate('YYYY-MM-DD') %>
---
--
title: <%- newNoteTitle %>
category: Meetings
--
Agenda...
```

#### Example: User Prompt for Title

```markdown
---
title: Meeting Template
type: blank-note
folder: My Meeting Folder
newNoteTitle: <%- prompt("What's the Subject of the meeting?") %>
---
--
title: <%- newNoteTitle %>
category: Meetings
--
Agenda...
```

<Callout type="tip">
Generally, you will want to use the `newNoteTitle` field in templates to set the note's title when creating a new note, e.g. with the `/New Note from Template` command.
