# Prompts

`Templating` provides the ability to ask the user questions through prompts when rendering templates. This page provides an overview of the different types of prompts available.

## Basic Prompts

Basic prompts allow you to collect simple text input or present users with a list of choices.

### Simple Text Input

The most basic form of prompt is a simple text input:

```markdown
<%- prompt('What is your first name?') %>
```

This will prompt the user to enter their first name and then display it at the location of the prompt in the template.

### Choice List Prompt

You can also create prompts with a list of predefined choices:

```markdown
Task Priority: <%- prompt('priority','What is task priority?',['high','medium','low']) %>
```

<Callout
  type="warning"
  title="PROMPT PLACEHOLDER/VARIABLE NAME"
  description="When using `prompt` command with anything other than a simple text input, you must supply a valid placeholder (variable) name (e.g. `name`) for the first parameter. You can use this variable name in your template to access the results of the prompt. The placeholder/variable name must contain valid characters:
  - must start with an alpha character (a..z, A..Z)
  - may only contain alphanumeric characters (a..z, A..Z, 0..9)
  - may **not** contain spaces
  Also, the variable name must be unique in the template, so if you use multiple prompts, make sure they use different variable names."
/>

### Define Early, Use Later

You can place prompts at the top of templates and use their values later in the template:

```markdown
<% prompt('lastName','What is your last name?') -%>

The rest of this could be your template code
And then finally use the `lastName` variable
<%- lastName %>
```

The template would render as follows, with the `lastName` value result from prompt on first line (assuming entered `lastName` Erickson):

```markdown
The rest of this could be your template code
And then finally use the `lastName` variable
Erickson
```

## Date Prompts

Date prompts provide specialized functions for collecting dates and date intervals.

```markdown
# Date input
<%- promptDate('startDate', 'Enter start date:') %>

# Date interval
<%- promptDateInterval('reviewInterval', 'Enter review interval:') %>
```

## Frontmatter Prompts

Frontmatter prompts allow you to select values from frontmatter attributes in notes, with support for regex pattern matching and folder filtering.

```markdown
# Basic frontmatter selection
<%- promptKey('projectStatus', 'Select project status:') %>

# With regex pattern
<%- promptKey('/status.*/', 'Select status:') %>
```

## Tag and Mention Prompts



Tag and mention prompts allow you to select from existing hashtags and @ mentions in your notes.

```markdown
# Tag selection
<%- promptTag('Select a hashtag:') %>

# Mention selection
<%- promptMention('Select a person:') %>
```
