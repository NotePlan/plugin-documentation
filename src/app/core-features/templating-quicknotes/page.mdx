# Quick Notes

Sometimes, you have templates that you apply often, and you would like to specify in advance, for example, the folder you want a new note to be placed in, the title of the note, and the template to use for the content.`Templating` **Quick Notes** are more specific templates for creating new notes.

## Quick Notes Templates

By default, Quick Notes templates are located in "ðŸ—’ Quick Notes" however you can place them where you wish within the "Templates" folder.

### Using Quick Notes

When you create a Quick Note template and include the `type: quick-note` attribute, it becomes available via the `np:qtn` command. When invoking the `np:qtn`, you will see the **Quick Note Template Picker**, where you can select the desired Quick Note template for which you want to create a new note.

**Step 1:** Invoke NotePlan Command Bar (`Command-J`)

**Step 2:** Type `/np:qtn` (or any of the `/qtn` <Link href="templating-commands" alt="aliases">aliases</Link>)

**Step 3:** Select desired template

After selecting the desired Quick Note, a new note will be created in the defined folder location as defined in the Quick Note template header.

If you only have a single Quick Note in the "ðŸ—’ Quick Notes" folder, it will be selected automatically and the Template Chooser dialog will not be displayed.

### Quick Note Template Required Attributes

Each Quick Note must contain each of the following items:

- `title` - contains the template title (this is what will appear in `np:qtn` template chooser)
- `type` - specifies that this is a Quick Note template (should include `quick-note` in this CSV list)
- `newNoteTitle` - will be name of new note. You can use any `Templating` module method, such as `<%- date.now() %>`, or a prompt command such as `<%- prompt('meetingSummary','What would you like to discuss') %>`
- `folder` - path to folder where new note will be created
  - if `folder` has a value of `<select>` new note will be created in the selected folder
  - if `folder` has a value of `<select path/to/folder>` new note will be created in a folder selected from the specified path
  - if `folder` has a value of `<current>` new note will be created in the folder of the currently displayed note

<Callout type="info" title="Quick Note Keyboard Shortcut">
You can speed things up even more by creating an x-callback link for your quick note, passing the title as a parameter, and you could use that as a link in your Daily Note or assign it to a keyboard shortcut to run the template with a single keystroke.
For example, you could run the Quick Note Template `My Template Title` with a single keystroke by creating a link in your Daily Note with the following x-callback URL:

`noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Templating&command=New%20note%20using%20Quick%20Note%20Template&arg0=My%20Template%20Title`
