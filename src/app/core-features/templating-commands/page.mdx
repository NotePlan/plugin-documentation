# Commands Overview

`Templating` provides a suite of default commands which can be executed within any note.

### Templating Initialization

There is a single command for initializing template configuration (will create new `Templating` [Plugin Settings](/docs/settings) if it does not exist) with new `Templating` configuration information).

It will also migrate existing templates in "📋 Templates" to NotePlan "Templates" folder (located in `Smart Folder` section at bottom of list) and migrate `quickNotes` defined in `_configuration` note

## Templating Creation Commands

The following default commands are included in `Templating` plugin and do not require any configuration

<Callout
  type="info"
  description={`
See <a href="templating-migrating" alt="migration commands">migration commands</a> below for more information about template migration
  `}
/>

#### Ignoring Templates

Any template which has a `type` of `ignore` will not be displayed in any of the `Templating` template chooser dialog

```markdown
---
title: Ignored Template
type: ignore
---

This template will not be displayed in any of the Templating template chooser dialog
```

---

### np:append

`np:append` will show a list of all templates located in the `Templates` folder, and will render at the cursor location of the current note.

_aliases: npa, append, at_

### np:insert

`np:insert` will show a list of all templates located in the `Templates` folder, and will render at the beginning of the current note.

_aliases: npi, insert, it_

### np:invoke

`np:invoke` will show a list of all templates in the `Templates` folder, and will render template in current note based on the `location` attribute value in template.

#### The `location` attribute may be one of the following

> `append` appends to the end of current note (same as `np:append`)

> `cursor` inserts at the cursor position of the current note

> `insert` inserts at the beginning of current note (same as `np:insert`)

_aliases: npv, invoke_

_Example_

```
---
title: Location Example
type: empty-note
location: cursor
---
This content will be placed in current note using the `location` attribute
```

### np:new

`np:new` will show a list of all templates in the `Templates` folder, then create a new project note using supplied note name.

_aliases: npn, new, nn_

### np:qtn

`np:qtn` will show a list of available Quick Note templates, and will create new note using selected Quick Note template.

_aliases: npq, qnt, qtn, quick, qqq_

<Callout
  type="critical"
  description={`
You must assign a <code>type</code> of <code>quick-note</code> for it to be available when using <code>np:qtn</code> command. Refer to <a href="templating-quicknotes" alt="quicknotes"> Quick Notes </a> for more detailed information.
  
  `}
/>

## Reserved Template Attributes

When using the `np:new` or `np:qtn` commands, there are two reserved attributes which may be defined in template attributes, that when template rendered, will tell `Templating` the name of new note, and folder where new note will be created

### newNoteTitle

The `newNoteTitle` attribute will be used to define name of new note

<Callout
  type="info"
  description={`
If the <code>newNoteTitle</code> is not supplied, you will be prompted to enter a new note title.
`}
>
  **IMPORTANT**: The folder field will only be used if you are using the `/New
  Note from Template` (aka `np:new`) command. It does not work if you are trying
  to insert a template in a note that already exists (e.g. using the button in
  the Editor).
</Callout>

#### Example 1:

This example will use the `newNoteTitle` value of "My New Note" to create the new note.

```markdown
---
title: Sample
newNoteTitle: 'My New Note'
---
```

#### Example 2:

A more useful example (static notes will just create duplicate notes in the `folder`) we can build up the note using the `Templating` [Date Module](/docs/templating-modules/date-module)

```markdown
---
title: Sample
newNoteTitle: "<%- prompt('meetingSummary','What would you like to discuss') %> <%- date.now() %>"
---
```

When the template is rendered, a prompt will be displayed requesting `meetingSummary` and then appended with the current date (e.g. "Talk about Templating 2022-04-25")

### folder

The `folder` attribute will be used to define where new note is created

<Callout
  type="info"
  description={`
If a folder is not supplied, the new note will be created at the root level of your project notes.
  `}
>

</Callout>

#### Example 1:

The following example will use the "current note folder location" as location where new note will be created

```markdown
---
title: Current Folder
folder: <current>
---
```

#### Example 2:

The following example will display list of all folders to choose location of new note

```markdown
---
title: Current Folder
folder: <select>
---
```

<img src={folderchooser.src} alt="Folder Chooser" />

#### Example 3:

The following construct the `folder` location using using fixed values first part of folder location, with last folder using [Date Module](/docs/templating-modules/date-module) `date.now('YYYY-MM')`

```markdown
---
title: Custom Folder
folder: "- 🛠 Projects/00 - 👨🏽‍💻codedungeon/📆 Meetings/<%- date.now('YYYY-MM') %>"
---
```

When rendered, `folder` value will appear something like

"- 🛠 Projects/00 - 👨🏽‍💻codedungeon/📆 Meetings/2022-04 (the last part will change dynamically based on current date using the 'YYYY-MM' format supplied to `date.now()`)"
