# Terminology
To further understand how `Templating` works, let's define a few important items:

- A template is a note which contains text and commands
- A text snippet that starts with an opening tag `&lt;%-`, ends with a closing tag `&gt;%` and contains a **variable** or **method** (which is referred to as command or placeholder). You can refer to [Templating - Commands](/docs/templating-commands/overview) to find more advanced usage of commands
- A **variable** or **method** is an object that we can invoke using a [template command](/docs/templating-commands/overview) and that returns a value (the replacement string)

There are two types of **variables**/**methods** you can use in your templates:

- [Template Methods](/templating/templating-modules). They are predefined **variables/methods** that are built within the plugin. For example, `date.now` is an internal variable that will return the current date.
- User defined functions. Other NotePlan plugins can extend `Templating` built-in **variables/methods** with their own custom variable or methods. For example `sweepTasks` or `listTodaysEvents` are custom plugin functions which operate on NotePlan tasks or events.

For example, the following template contains 1 variable (`firstName`) and 2 commands from `DateModule` (`yesterday`, and `tomorrow`)
- `Templating` variables do not have left and right parenthesis
- `Templating` methods contain an opening and closing parenthesis, followed by _optional_ parameter(s)

```markdown
First Name: &lt;% firstName &gt;%
Yesterday: &lt;% date.yesterday() &gt;%
Tomorrow: &lt;% date.tomorrow("YYYY-MM-DD") &gt;%
```
