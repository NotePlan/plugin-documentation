# Template Runner

## Motivation

`New Note from Template` or `Append Template` or `Insert Template` are the most common ways to use templates. However, these methods are not flexible enough to meet all your needs. For instance, what if you want to have Shortcuts or Keyboard Maestro trigger a template to run and insert content into a note of your choosing? Or what if you want a keyboard shortcut/callback (x-callback-url) that will insert specific content under a specific heading in a note of your choosing? This is where Template Runner comes in.

## Overview

`Templating` includes the `templateRunner` command to allow templates to be invoked from callback URLs or triggers. This allows you to use a template to insert content (including dynamic Templating tag-generated content) into a note of your choosing. It can do so silently (e.g. just write to a note but not pull it up in the Editor or display the note you specify at run-time). 

Template Runner templates can be activated in two ways:
1. **Callback URLs**: When a link is clicked from within or outside of NotePlan (e.g. Shortcuts, Keyboard Maestro or wherever)
2. **Triggers**: Automatically when certain events occur in NotePlan (e.g. when a note is saved)

This gives you a way to pass arbitrary information into your notes and automate template execution based on NotePlan events.

<Callout type="info">
Template Runner is a hidden command to be run from a callback URL or trigger. It is not a command that you can call from the Command Bar.
</Callout>

## Required Attributes

At its core, a Template Runner template is a basic template note with frontmatter. You need **one** of the following attributes to specify what document to work with:

### newNoteTitle (for creating new notes)

When you want to create a new note, use `newNoteTitle` in the template's frontmatter. This will:
- Create a new note with the specified title
- Bypass any other note selection logic (e.g. `getNoteTitled`)
- Use the template content as the new note's content

### getNoteTitled (for working with existing notes)

When you want to work with an existing note, use `getNoteTitled`. The value can be one of the following:

- a note title - should be a unique title (you will get the first note if there are more than one)
- `<current>` - the currently opened note in the NotePlan Editor
- `<today>` - today's note on whatever day the link is clicked to run the template
- `<thisweek>`
- `<nextweek>`
- `<choose>` - user will be asked to select a note at run-time

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: `getNoteTitled` is only used when you don't specify `newNoteTitle`.
</Callout>

### Note Creation vs. Note Selection

If both `newNoteTitle` and `getNoteTitled` are specified, TemplateRunner has a priority system for determining how to handle notes:

1. **`newNoteTitle` (Highest Priority)** - Creates a new note with the specified title
4. **`getNoteTitled` (Second Priority)** - If you are not creating a new note, you need to specify the note you want to work with

Example for existing notes:

```markdown
---
title: My template runner template with getNoteTitled
getNoteTitled: My Tasks Document Title
type: template-runner
---
This line will be the added to the `My Tasks Document Title` note after the link is clicked
```
### Simple Example with newNoteTitle and Variables

Here's a basic example that demonstrates using `newNoteTitle` with arguments `taskDescription` and `taskDate` passed via the callback URL to create a new note:

```markdown
---
title: Quick Task Template
newNoteTitle: <%- taskDescription %> - <%- taskDate %>
type: template-runner
---
## Note content here
```

**Callback URL example:**
```
noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Templating&command=templateRunner&arg0=Quick%20Task%20Template&arg1=false&arg2=taskDescription%3DBuy%20groceries;taskDate%3D2024-01-15
```

This will create a new note titled "Buy groceries - 2024-01-15" with the task details formatted as a proper note.

## Other Attributes

If no other arguments are set in the Template, the specified note will simply be opened in the Editor (see link creation below). However, things get more interesting when you set some of the optional fields below. the following attributes control how template content is inserted into the target note.

### replaceNoteContents

The simplest templateRunner template wipes out the contents of the note specified in `getNoteTitled` and replaces the note contents with the value of the template

The value of `replaceNoteContents` can be 'true' or 'yes' -- omitted for false

**Note:**:
If `replaceNoteContents` is true, then `location` and `writeUnderHeading` are ignored

Example:

```markdown
---
getNoteTitled: My Tasks Document Title
replaceNoteContents: true
---
### <% - date.timestamp() %> This line will be the text in the document after the link is clicked
```

### writeUnderHeading

The `writeUnderHeading` attribute tells Template Runner _under which heading_ to place the template content if you are not replacing all the note's contents. By default, content will be prepended (immediately following the heading). If a heading that you specify here does not exist in the _getNotetitled_ note, the heading and content will be created and added to the end of the note (but you can change that behavior with the `addHeadingLocation` attribute -- see below).

<Callout>
  IMPORTANT NOTE: writeUnderHeading uses NotePlan's definition of a block,
  replacing all text from the header specified until another header of the same
  or greater value or two consecutive empty lines. So if your heading is a ## level and you have ### level
  headings directly under it, those items will be deleted. Same with horizontal rules (---). NotePlan looks only for a higher level heading to stop at. Make sure to have a
  heading of level ## or # underneath. If you want, you can use the @Stacey
  trick and place a line with just a blank ` # ` at the bottom of your section, which will not show visibly but will be treated as an H1,
  when the replacer hits it and nothing beneath that line will be overwritten.
</Callout>

The `writeUnderHeading` attribute can be either:

- a heading name
- `<choose>` - will dynamically ask the user to choose a heading to insert the content under at run-time.

Example:

```markdown
---
getNoteTitled: <today>
writeUnderHeading: My Daily Journal
---
### <% - date.timestamp() %> 
This text will appear in my daily note under the heading *My Daily Journal*
```

### location

The `location` attribute tells Template Runner where/how to place the template contents. The behavior depends on whether you're using `writeUnderHeading` or operating on the whole note.

#### When using `writeUnderHeading`

- `prepend` - (the default) - adds content at the beginning of the text under the specified heading
- `append` - adds content at the end of the text under the specified heading  
- `replace` - replaces all text under the heading with the new template content. **Note:** This uses NotePlan's definition of where a heading's content starts/ends. It will replace all text until either (a) a heading of the same or greater heading level is located, or (b) two empty lines are reached. So if you have "---" horizontal rules, etc. they will be replaced.

#### When not using `writeUnderHeading` (operating on the whole note)

- `prepend` - (the default) - adds content at the top of the note
- `append` - adds content at the bottom of the note
- `cursor` - if `getNoteTitled` is set to `<current>`, inserts content at the current cursor position

> _Tip_:
> Make sure your target note has another heading of the same or higher level underneath it. If necessary, you can even put in a blank heading, e.g.:
> `# `
> ...which will not be seen by users but will define the end of the previous heading's block.

Example:

```markdown
---
getNoteTitled: <thisweek>
writeUnderHeading: Thoughts for the week
location: prepend
---
### <% - date.timestamp() %>
This text will appear in my daily note under the heading *Thoughts for the week*, but underneath any text that has been written before
```

<Callout>
When you specify `writeUnderHeading`, by default, content is appended to the end of the content under the heading. You can change that with `location` -- as demonstrated above. Additionally, if the heading does not yet exist in the target note, it will be created -- by default as a level 2 heading, appended to the end of the note. You can change that behavior though: 
</Callout>

### addHeadingLocation

The `addHeadingLocation` attribute tells Template Runner where in the note to add a new heading if it creates one.  `addHeadingLocation` can be 
- `append` (the default)
- `prepend`

### headingLevel

When a heading is added, `headingLevel` dictates what heading level it will be (default 2)

### createMissingHeading (default: true)

By default, if you have a `writeUnderHeading` and that heading doesn't exist, the heading will be created at the end of the note (appended) and your contents will be placed underneath. You can change that to the beginning of the note by setting `addHeadingLocation` to 'prepend' in your frontmatter.

On the other hand, if you want the heading and block to not be created at all if the heading did not exist in the note, set `createMissingHeading: false`. However, be warned that the content that was passed to the script will be lost because it will not be written anywhere.

### replaceHeadingAlso

When you have `writeUnderHeading` and `location: replace` set, this parameter controls whether to replace just the content under the heading or the heading itself as well.

- **`replaceHeadingAlso: true`** - Replaces both the heading and its content
- **`replaceHeadingAlso: false`** (default) - Only replaces the content under the heading, keeping the original heading

This is useful when you want to completely replace a section including its title, rather than just updating the content within an existing section.

Example:

```markdown
---
getNoteTitled: <today>
writeUnderHeading: My Daily Journal
location: append
addHeadingLocation: prepend
headingLevel: 3
---
```
This example will open Today's note, find the "My Daily Journal" section, and (because of `location: append`), will add the content you passed in the URL to the bottom of that section/block. 

However, if the "My Daily Journal" section does not yet exist, it will be added to the top of today's note (due to `addHeadingLocation: prepend`) with a heading level of 3 (`###`).

## Passing variable content (you can add as many arbitrary variables as you want)

The real power of Template Runner Templates comes from including dynamic variables in the Callback URL and using those in the template. Any variable name that is not a reserved word can be passed in the URL and used in your template when it is run by Template Runner.

Example (basically the same as above, but with variable content)

```markdown
---
getNoteTitled: <thisweek>
writeUnderHeading: Thoughts for the week
location: append
---
### <% - date.timestamp() %> <%- var1 %>
```

Notice how in this example, `var1` is not set in the frontmatter. This is a variable value that is passed through in your callback link, in this example, perhaps you passed through some thoughts that you dictated (and encoded using Shortcuts) as `...var1=My%20Thoughts%etc`. Template Runner passses through all the variables it receives to the Templating Engine to include in values just as if you had included those values in frontmatter.

> _Tip_
> Because it's hard to predict what words are reserved in the Templating system, we suggest you use names that are very unlikely to exist elsewhere. For example, _var1_, _var2_, _var3_ or something like _myThoughtsVar_

## Trigger-Based Template Runner

In addition to being called via callback URLs, Template Runner can also be triggered automatically by NotePlan events. This allows you to run templateRunner templates when certain actions occur in NotePlan, such as when a note is saved.

### templateTitle (required for triggers)

When using triggers, you need to specify the name of the templateRunner template to execute in the `templateTitle` frontmatter attribute of the note that will trigger the template.

Example:

```markdown
---
title: My Note
templateTitle: write modified time to frontmatter
triggers: onEditorWillSave => np.Templating.templateRunner
---
```

In this example, when the note is saved, the templateRunner will execute the template named "write modified time to frontmatter".

### Setting up the Trigger

To set up a trigger, you need to add a `triggers` attribute to your note's frontmatter. The trigger should call the `templateRunner` command from the `np.Templating` plugin.

Common trigger patterns:
- `onEditorWillSave => np.Templating.templateRunner` - runs when the note is about to be saved
- `onEditorDidSave => np.Templating.templateRunner` - runs after the note has been saved

## Running a Template Runner Template

X-Callback-Links, especially ones with lots of variables attached, can be a bit daunting. The easiest way to get a URL to invoke your template is by using the `Link Creator` plugin and the command `/Get X-Callback-URL`, and selecting `RUN a TemplateRunner type template`. This command will help you create a link and pass variables through to Template Runner. The easiest way to get there is to go to have your TemplateRunner template open and open the Command Bar and invoke `/Get Callback URL`. Click `RUN a TemplateRunner type template`. If you don't have the Link Creator plugin, you can install it from the Plugins by going to the NotePlan Preferences and clicking the Plugins tab.

## Examples

### Simple Example - Running your Daily Template from outside NotePlan

In this example, we will start with a simple daily notes template and convert this to be a Template Runner-enabled template to allow it to be applied by opening a URL. Once this is set up, you can use another application to launch the URL which will open NotePlan and apply the template automatically. This is useful to launch NotePlan first thing in the morning and ensure you start off with your daily template applied.

Let's start with the sample Daily Template that is included with NotePlan:

```markdown
---
title: Daily Note (Simple)
type: empty-note
documentation: https://help.noteplan.co/article/136-templates
---
## Tasks

## Journal

- How did it go yesterday (<%= np.date.yesterday("Do MMMM YYYY") %>)?:
- Today's (<%= np.date.now("Do MMMM YYYY") %>) goal is: `} />

```

In the frontmatter section, add the following properties:

```markdown
getNoteTitled: <TODAY>
location: append
```

This will tell `templateRunner` to open today's daily note and append the content of the template to the note. In this example, we are not passing any additional variables with the URL. We are just using Template Runner to run the template on our daily note.

You can then use the `Link Creator` plugin to walk through generating link to apply your template.

1. Open the command bar
2. Invoke `/Get X-Callback-URL`
3. Select `RUN a template`
4. Select your template - that would be `Daily Note (Simple)` in our exmple above
5. Select **Yes** on the dialog presented to confirm you want to open the note in the editor
6. Click **OK** in the next prompt for parameters - we don't have any parameters to send in for this example.
7. Select **No** in the next prompt asking whether to return to other app

At this point, you can opt to have a raw link or a pretty link inserted into your note, which you can then copy and paste elsewhere. The link should look something like this:

```markdown
noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Templating&command=templateRunner&arg0=Daily%20Note%20%28Simple%29&arg1=true
```

### Basic Variable-Passing Example

In this example, I use Template Runner to add a house "fix-it" item to my weekend chore list whenever the need arises (using my template named _addFixIt_):

```markdown
---
title: addFixIt
type: template-runner (this is not necessary, just a reminder to me of what this template is)
getNoteTitled:  "⭐️ Tasks"
writeUnderHeading: "fix-its"
location: append
exampleSilent: noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Templating&command=templateRunner&arg0=addFixIt&arg1=false&arg2=textVar%3Dsomething
---
* <%- textVar %> #fixit
```

As you can probably tell, what this does is add a todo item underneath the heading "fix-its" in my note "⭐️ Tasks". arg2 is set to `false` so the text will be added behind the scenes, and will not change the note currently in the Editor. The variable "textVar" is set to the word "something" in this example, but in my real use of this link, _something_ is replaced with the URL Encoded text that I dicated into a Shortcut.

### Another Variable-Passing Example

This is a Shortcut I use to log a workout during the day under my "Today's Notes & Actions" heading:

```markdown
---
title: logWorkout
openNoteTitle:  <TODAY>
writeUnderHeading: "Today's Notes & Actions"
location: append
exampleURL: noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Templating&command=templateRunner&arg0=logWorkout&arg1=true&arg2=var1%3DVALUE1%3Bvar2%3DVALUE2
---
### <% - date.timestamp() %> #workout <%- var1 %> | <%- var2 %>
```

In this example, I passed two variables (var1 and var2) corresponding to two prompts I use in Shortcuts. All variables are passed in as arg2 in the form of:
`arg1=VALUE1;arg2=VALUE2` (template variables are separated by semicolons)
After these variables are URL-encoded, they look like this in the final URL:
`...arg2=var1%3DVALUE1%3Bvar2%3DVALUE2`
...now you probably see why the `URL Creator` will save you so much trial and error.

### Trigger-Based Example - Auto-Update Modified Time

This example demonstrates how to use Template Runner with triggers to automatically update a note's frontmatter when it's saved. This is useful for tracking when notes were last modified.

#### Trigger Note

The note that will trigger the templateRunner:

```markdown
---
title: Test of templateRunner trigger with no args
templateTitle: write modified time to frontmatter
triggers: onEditorWillSave => np.Templating.templateRunner
modified: 7/16/2025, 1:54:11 AM
---
```

#### TemplateRunner Template

The template that will be executed when the note is saved:

```markdown
---
title: write modified time to frontmatter
type: meeting-note, empty-note
---
```templatejs
    const theTime = new Date().toISOString() || new Date().toLocaleString()
    updateFrontmatterVars(Editor, {
      modified: user?.first||'' ? `${theTime} (${authorID})` : theTime,
    })
```

In this example:
1. When the trigger note is saved, the `templateRunner` will execute the "write modified time to frontmatter" template
2. The template uses JavaScript to get the current timestamp
3. It updates the `modified` field in the note's frontmatter with the current time
4. If a user is logged in, it includes the user's name in parentheses

### Super Advanced Example - Inline Meeting Notes

This example is a bit more involved, and requires two separate templates. The first template is configured as a meeting note template (`type: meeting-note`) and is used to run a bit of JavaScript which then calls the `templateRunner` plugin with the second template.

#### First Template

The template below can be copied as-is and placed in your template folder. Feel free to change the name, but leave the JavaScript code unmodified. I called this template **Inline Meeting Notes** because when used, it will insert the meeting notes into my daily note, rather than creating a standalone note file.

When this template is invoked, it will run the JavaScript code. The first line of the code creates a parameter string to pass to templateRunner, and includes all the variables you would typically use in a meeting notes template. Because our second template is not being triggered by any traditional meeting note workflow, it doesn't have a link to an event. Without an event, it doesn't have access to these variables, so we must pass them in.

The second line of code calls the templateRunner command, and passes in both a target template, and the list of parameters just constructed. In this example, the target template is called **Meeting Notes**. If you want to change the name of the target template, make sure to update this code as well.

```markdown
---
title: Inline Meeting Notes
type: meeting-note
---
const eventInfoString = \`eventTitle=\${eventTitle};eventNotes=\${eventNotes};eventLink=\${eventLink};calendarItemLink=\${calendarItemLink};eventAttendees=\${eventAttendees};eventAttendeeNames=\${eventAttendeeNames};eventLocation=\${eventLocation};eventCalendar=\${eventCalendar};eventDate=\${eventDate('YYYY-MM-DD')};eventStart=\${eventDate("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM")};eventEnd=\${eventEndDate("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM")}\`
await DataStore.invokePluginCommandByName("templateRunner","np.Templating",["Meeting Notes",true,eventInfoString])
```

#### Second Template

The second template will look more like a traditional meeting note template,
but will include additional frontmatter attributes needed by templateRunner.
In this case, we're telling templateRunner to do the following:

1. Open today's daily note
2. Put the content of the template under the heading **Today's Notes**
3. Append the content of the template within this heading (newer notes at
   the bottom)

```markdown
---
title: Meeting Notes
getNoteTitle:  <TODAY>
writeUnderHeading: "Today's Notes"
location: append
---
### <%- eventTitle %> - <%- eventDate %>
**Event:**  <%- calendarItemLink %>
```
## Shortcuts TemplateRunner Example

Here's  a TemplateRunner template that dynamically opens a note and prepends text to the top of the note.
The shortcut sends 3 pieces of information:
- the name of the Template which will process the response
- the noteTitle of the note that should be opened
- the text to be prepended

The template receives this info, opens the named note, and prepends the text to the top of the note

<img src={templateRunnerShortcuts.src} alt="TemplateRunner Shortcuts" />

Here's the [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a3c83fbd9ce9466d84f56b5fa5f23a42)

Here's the very basic TemplateRunner template (note that the properties in the frontmatter between the `---` and `---` below would be edited in the properties editor in NotePlan as you see in the screenshot above):
~~~markdown
---
title: Scott C Shortcuts Text Insert TR Template
type: templateRunner
getNoteTitled: <%- noteName %>
location: prepend
NOTE: Takes in a note name from Shortcuts and prepends text
---
<%- textToInsert %>
~~~
You will notice that the Shortcut passes URL-encoded variables to the template. In this case, the variables are:
- `noteName` - the name of the note to open
- `textToInsert` - the text to prepend to the note

...but you could pass any number of variables to the template and use them in the template.


## Comprehensive Example - All Parameters Set

Here's a complete TemplateRunner template example that demonstrates every available parameter:

```markdown
---
title: Comprehensive TemplateRunner Example
type: template-runner
newNoteTitle: <%- myTitle %> - <%- date.now('YYYY-MM-DD') %>
getNoteTitled: <today>
writeUnderHeading: <%- sectionName %>
location: replace
addHeadingLocation: prepend
headingLevel: 3
createMissingHeading: true
replaceNoteContents: false
replaceHeadingAlso: true
---
*Generated by TemplateRunner at <%- date.now('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss') %>*
<% - content %>
```

**Parameter Breakdown:**

- **`newNoteTitle`**: Creates a new note with dynamic title (highest priority)
- **`getNoteTitled`**: Target note (only used if `newNoteTitle` is not set)
- **`writeUnderHeading`**: Section to write under (creates if doesn't exist)
- **`location`**: Where to place content (`append`, `prepend`, `replace`, `cursor`)
- **`addHeadingLocation`**: Where to add new headings (`append`, `prepend`)
- **`headingLevel`**: Heading level for new headings (default: 2)
- **`createMissingHeading`**: Set to `false` to prevent creation of missing headings
- **`replaceNoteContents`**: Set to `true` to replace entire note content
- **`replaceHeadingAlso`**: Set to `true` to replace both heading and content when using `location: replace`

**Usage:** This template can be called with variables like:
- `myTitle`: The title for the new note (the template above will add the current date to the end of the title)
- `sectionName`: The heading to write under
- `content`: Main content to insert

**Callback URL example:**
```
noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=np.Templating&command=templateRunner&arg0=Comprehensive%20TemplateRunner%20Example&arg1=false&arg2=myTitle%3DMeeting%20Notes%3BsectionName%3DWork%20Notes%3Bcontent%3DDiscuss%20Q4%20planning
```

This comprehensive example shows how all the TemplateRunner parameters work together to create a powerful, flexible template system.
