# Using JavaScript in Templates

`Templating` can be configured to execute a wide variety of JavaScript commands, directly in the template.

Using the leading tag `<%` at the beginning of line will instruct `Templating` to interpret whatever comes next as a standard JavaScript command, but will not output anything when the template is rendered, and when combined with the `<%-` tag, you can then output any variable you created previously when the template is rendered.

**Example**

The following will instruct `Templating` to initialize a variable `firstName` with the value of `Mike`

```javascript
<% const firstName = 'Mike' %>
```

Then, you can output the value when rendered using one of the `Templating` output tags

```javascript
<%- firstName %> // output Mike
```

<Callout type="info">
Keep in mind that the line `<% const firstName = 'Mike' %>` will not output any text, but it is on a line by itself with a return/newline at the end which will be output as part of the rendered template. You can suppress this by adding a `-` to the template tag, e.g. `<% const firstName = 'Mike' -%>` This will set the variable but not output anything at all.
</Callout>

## Complex Example

To demonstrate how to use JavaScript commands inside templates, we will use the `openweathermap.org` API to gather weather information based on a predefined lat/long combination.

While the [Web Module](/docs/templating-modules/web-module) `weather()` command provides numerous formatting options, it is based on your current location using the devices "IP Address", which varies based on your current location (and can be random when using a VPN connection).

### Using Latitude/Longitude (lat/long)

If you would like to have greater control, you can also use a service such as `openweathermap.org` API to retrieve weather, utilizing predefined lat/long value and you own personal API key.

title: Get the Weather
step1: go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for a free account https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
step2: get an API KEY https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and paste it below after where it says API_KEY
step3: find the lat/long for your location by going to google maps https://www.google.com/maps, searching for an address and then right-clicking that address on a map. Insert your the latitude (the first number) and longitude (the second number) below
step4: set what type of units you want your result returned in - metric (for 째C) or imperial (for 째F)
API_KEY: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LAT: 40.662102
LONG: -73.955223
UNITS: imperial
type: ignore
