# Example: Using JavaScript for Weather API

To demonstrate how to use JavaScript commands inside templates, we will use the `openweathermap.org` API to gather weather information based on a predefined lat/long combination.

While the [Web Module](/built-in-modules/templating-modules-web) `weather()` command provides numerous formatting options, it is based on your current location using the devices "IP Address", which varies based on your current location (and can be random when using a VPN connection).

### Using Latitude/Longitude (lat/long)

If you would like to have greater control, you can also use a service such as `openweathermap.org` API to retrieve weather, utilizing predefined lat/long value and you own personal API key.

title: Get the Weather
step1: go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for a free account https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
step2: get an API KEY https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and paste it below after where it says API_KEY
step3: find the lat/long for your location by going to google maps https://www.google.com/maps, searching for an address and then right-clicking that address on a map. Insert your the latitude (the first number) and longitude (the second number) below
step4: set what type of units you want your result returned in - metric (for 째C) or imperial (for 째F)
API_KEY: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LAT: 40.662102
LONG: -73.955223
UNITS: imperial
type: ignore
