# Display the Week in Quarter

This example demonstrates how to create a visual progress indicator showing the current week's position within a quarter. It uses JavaScript to calculate the quarter, week progress, and displays it with filled and empty circles. Thanks to [Chris Lacey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislacey89/) for [posting](https://discord.com/channels/763107030223290449/1325129182375710862/1325129182375710862) this to the community, and @jgclark for improving upon it.

## Output

When used in a note titled "2024-W15" (for example), this template will generate:

<img src={weekInQuarterImage.src} alt="Week in Quarter Progress Display" className="week-quarter-example" />

    'This example uses JavaScript code blocks within templates. The code calculates quarter information based on the currently selected daily Calendar note.'
  }
/>

## Template

To use this example, either:
- include this code in your daily template 
- create a new template inside NotePlan by right-clicking "Templates" in the left sidebar and then "New Template". Then copy the template below.

~~~markdown
```templatejs
if (!/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/.test(Editor.title)) throw "You can only run this on a daily calendar note."
const today = new Date(Editor.title);
const currentWeekNumber = Calendar.weekNumber(today); // respects user's start of week
const currentYear = today.getFullYear();

function getCurrentQuarter(weekOfYear) {
  if (weekOfYear <= 13) return 1;
  if (weekOfYear <= 26) return 2;
  if (weekOfYear <= 39) return 3;
  return 4;
}

function getWeekProgressOfQuarter(quarter, weekOfYear) {
  return weekOfYear - ((quarter - 1) * 13);
}

const currentQuarter = getCurrentQuarter(currentWeekNumber);
const currentProgress = getWeekProgressOfQuarter(currentQuarter, currentWeekNumber);
const filledCircles = "●".repeat(Math.max(currentProgress - 1, 0));
const currentDayMarker = "●";
const emptyCircles = "○".repeat(Math.max(13 - currentProgress, 0));
```
W<%- currentWeekNumber %> [in Q<%- currentQuarter %>: <%- filledCircles + currentDayMarker + emptyCircles %>]
```
~~~

## How It Works

The template performs several key operations:

1. **Extracts Week Number**: Gets the week number from the note title (assumes it's a daily Calendar note)
2. **Calculates Quarter**: Determines which quarter the week falls into (Q1: weeks 1-13, Q2: weeks 14-26, etc.)
3. **Determines Progress**: Calculates how many weeks into the current quarter we are
4. **Creates Visual Indicator**: 
   - `●` (filled circles) represent completed weeks in the quarter
   - `●` (current marker) represents the current week
   - `○` (empty circles) represent remaining weeks in the quarter

## Use Cases

This template is particularly useful for:

- **Weekly Planning**: Visual progress tracking within quarters
- **Project Management**: Understanding quarter-based timelines
- **Productivity Tracking**: Seeing how much of the quarter remains
- **Calendar Notes**: Quick visual reference in weekly note headers
