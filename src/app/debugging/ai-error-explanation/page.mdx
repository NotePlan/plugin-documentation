# AI Error Explanation

Templating 2.0 has incorporated AI-powered error explanation to help you quickly understand and resolve template processing issues.

## How It Works

When Templating encounters an error while processing your template, and you have an active internet connection, the system will automatically use AI to:

- Analyze the error
- Provide a human-readable explanation of what went wrong
- Suggest specific steps to fix the issue

## What Triggers AI Explanation

AI error explanation is automatically triggered when:

- Templating encounters a processing error
- You have an active internet connection
- The error is significant enough to halt template execution

## When AI Explanation Might Not Be Enough

For most issues, AI error explanation will provide sufficient information to resolve the problem. However, you may need additional debugging if:

- The error is not severe enough to trigger AI explanation
- You need more detailed information about the template execution process
- The AI explanation doesn't fully resolve your specific use case

In these cases, you should proceed to [Console Logging](/debugging/console-logging) for more detailed troubleshooting, including verbose logging options.

## Example AI Explanations

Here are some common types of AI explanations you might see:

### Syntax Errors
```
Error: Unexpected token '}' at line 15
AI Explanation: You have an extra closing brace '}' on line 15. This suggests you either have a missing opening brace earlier in your template, or you have one too many closing braces. Check your template structure to ensure all braces are properly paired.
```

### Variable Reference Errors
```
Error: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined
AI Explanation: You're trying to access the 'title' property of a variable that doesn't exist or is undefined. Make sure the variable is properly defined before using it, or add a conditional check to handle cases where it might be undefined.
```

### Module Errors
```
Error: Method 'invalidMethod' not found in date module
AI Explanation: The method 'invalidMethod' doesn't exist in the date module. Check the documentation for available date module methods, or verify you've spelled the method name correctly.
```
