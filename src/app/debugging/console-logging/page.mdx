# Console Logging

When AI error explanation isn't sufficient or you need more detailed information about template execution, you can use NotePlan's Console Log to view detailed debugging information.

## Opening the Console Log

To access the Console Log in NotePlan, follow the first part of the instructions to open the Console Log and debug plugins. You will open the configuration for Templating.

**[Console Log Setup Guide](https://noteplan.co/n/4515666C-19C8-4637-83DF-6248C12AFC92)**.

## When to Use Console Logging

Console logging is particularly useful for:

- **Silent Failures**: When templates don't work but don't show obvious errors
- **Performance Issues**: When templates run slowly or hang
- **Complex Logic**: When debugging intricate conditional statements or loops
- **Module Interactions**: When troubleshooting how different modules work together
- **Variable Values**: When you need to see what values variables contain during execution

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Open**: When you are debugging, leave the Console Log open while developing and testing templates
2. **Clear Regularly**: Clear the console between tests to avoid confusion
3. **Look for Patterns**: Pay attention to recurring messages that might indicate systematic issues
4. **Note Timing**: Observe when messages appear to understand execution flow

## Enabling Verbose Logging

For even more detailed debugging information, you can enable verbose logging by adding a special property to your template's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
verboseLog: true
---
```

  description="Verbose logging requires that you have the Console Log open to view the additional output. Make sure to follow the console setup instructions above first."
/>

### Disabling Verbose Logging

To disable verbose logging, either:

- **Remove the property**: Delete the `verboseLog: true` line from your frontmatter

## Troubleshooting Strategy

When debugging templates, follow this progressive approach:

1. **Start with AI Error Explanation**: Most issues will be resolved automatically
2. **Use Console Logging**: For general debugging and understanding execution flow
3. **Enable Verbose Logging**: For complex issues requiring detailed analysis

When analyzing logs:

1. **Start from the Error**: Find the error message and work backwards
2. **Check Variable Values**: Look for unexpected variable contents
3. **Trace Execution Flow**: Follow the step-by-step execution to find where things go wrong
4. **Compare Expected vs. Actual**: Look for discrepancies between what you expected and what actually happened
5. **Time Analysis**: Check if any operations are taking unexpectedly long
