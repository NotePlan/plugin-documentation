# Templating Documentation

Welcome to the NotePlan Templating documentation! This guide will help you understand and use the powerful templating system in NotePlan.

## What is Templating?

`Templating` is a template language plugin for NotePlan that lets you insert variables and method results into your notes. It will also let you execute custom JavaScript constructed in the templates providing a rich note taking system.

## Why Use Templates?

Templates enables you to create structured and consistent notes for repetitive tasks. When invoked by one of the many `Templating` commands (e.g. `np:new`, `np:append`) the templating plugin replaces placeholders in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into a NotePlan note. This approach makes it easier to create notes in your day-to-day work.

- Encourages consistent notes (data generation is separate from presentation code)
- Output generation is more expressive (template syntax doesn't require a sea of string concatenation)
- Better productivity (common problems such as output encoding, iterating, conditionals, etc. have been handled)

## Quick Start

1. [Learn the basic concepts](/templating-terminology)
2. [Create your first template](/core-features/templating-anatomy)
3. [Explore built-in modules](/built-in-modules/templating-modules-date)

## Example: Meeting Notes

One of the unique features of NotePlan is the ability to combine normal note taking features (the _Note_) with an integrated calendar environment (the _Plan_) which provides a terrific place to manage a big part of your day-to-day work.

When viewing the meeting in the NotePlan Calendar View, you may wish to link the event to a NotePlan Meeting note:

<img src={noteplanevent.src} alt="NotePlan Event" />

Clicking on the "Link Note" button at the top of the event:

<img src={linknote.src} alt="NotePlan Event" />

You may select from one of the `meeting-note` templates in the "Templates" folder:

<Callout
  type="info"
  description={`
Any template which contains a type of <code>meeting-note</code> will be available in the NotePlan Meeting Note template chooser.
  `}
/>

<img src={choosetemplate.src} alt="NotePlan Event" />

When you select the desired template and click "Create Meeting Note", NotePlan will generate a new note, replacing template placeholders with information from the selected event, using a template such as the following:

<img src={meetingnotetemplate.src} alt="NotePlan Event" />

The end result will be a new note, which has a consistent format, making it easy to identify the important parts when you review notes in the future. Each of the placeholders (e.g. `<%- calendarItemLink %>` or `<%- eventNotes %>`) will be replaced with event attributes where applicable:

<img src={meetingnote.src} alt="NotePlan Event" />
