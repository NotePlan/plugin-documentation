# Installation

Templating ships as core plugin preinstalled with NotePlan. You don't need to install it. But you might want to check for updates in the NotePlan preferences > "AI & Plugins" (on Mac). The community sometimes uploads a patch for a bug before the full version of NotePlan includes it.

{/*

Installing the templating plugin is a simple process.
