# Help Creating Templates

When you need help creating templates for NotePlan, there are several resources available to assist you. We recommend trying them in the following order:

## 1. Check This Documentation First

Before seeking external help, please thoroughly review this documentation. It contains comprehensive information about:

- [Template syntax and structure](/core-features/templating-syntax)
- [Built-in modules and their functions](/built-in-modules/templating-modules-overview)
- [Advanced features and examples](/advanced-features)
- [Common use cases and templates](/examples-templates)
- [Debugging techniques](/debugging)

Most questions can be answered by exploring these sections of the documentation.

## 2. NotePlan Templating GPT

If you can't find the answer in the documentation, you can get help from the **NotePlan Templating Script Helper** GPT:

This AI assistant is specifically trained to help you write and debug templates for NotePlan. However, please keep in mind that **LLMs can hallucinate**, so you should expect code generated by the GPT to be about **80% accurate**. While it may not be perfect, it should help you get started and provide a good foundation for your template development.
